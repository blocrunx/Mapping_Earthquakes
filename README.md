# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to use the Mapbox API to produce an interactive map to visualize the last seven days of global seismic activity. The visualization was to include the following:
-	Three different map styles for the user to choose from.
-	A marker for each seismic event listed in the GeoJSON file.
-	A legend representing the earthquake marker colors.
-	GeoJSON polygon overlay to visualize the tectonic plates.
-	Functionality to toggle the earthquake marker and tectonic plate overlays on and off.
